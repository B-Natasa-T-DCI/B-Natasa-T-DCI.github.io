<p>Hi, my name is Natasa.</p>

<p>I come from Hungary, therefore I am Hungarian. I learned German as a child, but I forgot a lot since, because I switched to English in high school.</p>

<p>I have from ADHD, which to the current situation translates like this:</p>
        
<p>"I have auditory processing difficulties due to sensory overload."</p>

<P>I struggle with retaining information through speaking, due to overstimulation, so I learn things permanently at a slower pace.</p>

<p>(No worries though, I can manage it. I'm creative like that, but I can take ages on a project
    if I'm left alone without an instructor that I can bombard with out of the blue questions non-stop.)</p>
