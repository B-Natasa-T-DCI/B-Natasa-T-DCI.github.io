That line above me was already there when I got here. I guess I shouldn't touch it? (Still no idea what I'm doing here yet.)

So! This is my first project website where I will jolt down what I learn about HTML and also just try to build a bigger website notepad over time as a longer project.

It might take a while to actually make it look good, I prefer taking written notes while I am learning, so it takes a while to:

-Imagine what I want to do as a project
-Learn all the beginner basics in HTML and CSS by watching videos for some hours
-Make notes and explain the things I learned to myself so it sticks better
-Write down the written notes into the code as the filler
-Actually start practicing the things I learned
-Start writing down next to the code what I learned with my choice of words so I repeat what I have learned
-Try designing the site to see how it would look like with the theme I choose to the information that I am trying to share
