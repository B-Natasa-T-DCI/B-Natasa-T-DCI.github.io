<!--Rant to myself: I never created an actual website before, so I have no idea about the stages in a professional setting.
                    Where to start? How to start? What should I practice? How should it look like? What's the progress like? etc...
                    I'm not very good at doing random projects without very clear expectations sadly, but I'll have to start somewhere, so here we go.-->

<!--Things I want to try and implement...
    -I should include links for the videos and websites where I learned from somewhere actually.
    -Emulator skin colors + font
    -Add 3 pages about: CSS, JavaScript and Ubuntu terminal?-->

        <h1>Natasa's HTML notepad</h1> <!--The "Header 1" is usually used for a title on a website.-->
        
        <h2>The purpose of this site</h2> <!--The "Header 2" is used for subtitles, and this goes so on until "Header 6".-->
        
        <p>This website right now is here to explain things for me in layman terms. (most of the stuff is in the source code in forms of a butt load of comments...)
            It's just a "fancy" notepad of a sort to help me understand what I learn here in the class about HTML,
            since I suck at memorizing complicated theory and/or doing projects without clear and on-point written instructions.</p>
        
        <p>I suffer from ADHD, which to the current situation it translates as: I have auditory processing difficulties due to sensory overload.
            I struggle with retaining information through speaking, due to overstimulation, so I learn things permanently at a slower pace,
            'cause often times I just zone the hell out and forget things even happened.</p>
        
        <p>(No worries though, I can manage it. I'm creative like that, but I can take ages on a project if I'm left alone with it.)</p>
        
        <p>My only stress factor is, that what if I can't keep up with the class, cause I can get easily distracted when I research things endlessly and then miss the point on something important.
            When I self-study I might end up spending hours on something unnecessary and realize it much later that it will never be of use to me.</p>

        <p>Let's see then...</p>
